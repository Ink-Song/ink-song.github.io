            In this project we were divided into groups of five and given a Lego EV3 Mindstorms kit. The goal was to complete a series of assignments together as a team, and develop the soft skills involved with teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            We initially divided ourselves into roles, with each member responsible for a different aspect of the project. We had a defacto group leader, responsible for arranging meetings and we had a secretary, who documented the process and meetings. During actual group hours, each member more or less contributed to every aspect of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The communication skills and team building exercises employed here are something that I think will be very valuable going forward.
