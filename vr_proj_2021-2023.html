                In the period between 2021 and 2024 I worked on two separate VR training projects, both of which were to act as proof of concept demos. The first of these programs was Automatic Electric Defibrilator simulator, intended to teach users how to use the device. On this project I developed visuals and scripts relating to the function of the device itself. The second project was a Hazard Investigation training tool, intended to teach trainees how to perform a proper hazard and risk assessment. I served as sole developer of this project.

                While working on these projects I learned to plan and organize effectively.
