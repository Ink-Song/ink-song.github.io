            In this project we were divided into groups of five and given a Lego EV3 Mindstorms kit. The goal was to complete a series of assignments together as a team, and develop the soft skills involved with teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of the project involved learning how to use collaborative design software effectively as a team. In this project we used Gitlab as our tool for collaborating on code. This involved among other things using a Wiki to maintain oversight and issue boards to track progress and tasks throughout the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other side of the project was learning how to develop ourselves as a team, and how to coordinate effectively. We started the project fairly relaxed, but as the work load increased and deadlines neared, it became clear we had to take a more structured approach. Near the end of the project we pitched the idea of pre-workday meetings to be clear on what tasks remained and what needed to be done by the end of the day, as well as a quick rap up session at the end. In larger projects, we'll probably break this into sprint meetings instead.
        </p>

            This course has been very insightful so far, and I look forward to testing it on a larger project.
