            <hr>

            <h3>This User Interface (1995)</h3>

                <img src="/img/Windows_95_launch.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Windows 95 dropped on August 25th, 1995. It's simple, easy to navigate style made the use of a computer easier than ever before. Which makes this the ideal User Interface for someone of your advanced age.</p>
            <h3>Pokemon (1996)</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/img/pokemon-red-title.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The original pokemon games, in case you've forgotten them after so many gruelling years, took north america by storm in 1996. Since that time it has become the highest grossing media franchise of all time, earning over 98.9 Billion US Dollars. If you were to add your earnings together with the Pokemon Company, you would have approximately 98.9 Billion US dollars between you! Congrats!</p>
            <h3>Google (1998)</h3>
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            <p>This one's pretty self explanatory. When you were three google used to look like that^.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Wow, you sure are older than a lot of things. But we're not done yet, what else do you think is younger than you?</p>
            <h2>Other things you're older than...</h2>
            <h3>Public Radio (A long time ago)</h3>
            <p>Fun fact: The first radio broadcast was made by Reginald Fessenden in 1906. The first words uttered on public radio were reportedly "Good god you're old."</p>

            <p>That's the end of our list! Thanks for exploring this museum of ancient artifacts with me.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I just want to wish you the happiest of birthdays. While space my currently divide us, remember that the only thing greater than the distance between our homes is the monumental difference in our ages. Because you're old. Or something. Have I said that part yet?</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday Broski, and to many more great years!</p>
