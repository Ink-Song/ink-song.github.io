        <h3>Project Outline</h3>
        <p>This was the final project in our course for Teamwork and Team Building. The goal was to work together as a team to create a functional lego prototype that solved some form of problem. While the project itself was based around building this robot, the real focus was to apply the ideas we'd learned about teamwork to a practical project.</p>
        <p>We were given approximately 1-2 months to complete the project.</p>
        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>Following the above rules my group and I decided to create a robot using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 system that could water plants.</p>
        <img src="/img/WaterRobotOkt112024.png" alt="A rought sketch indicating a lego robot design.">
        <p class="subtlet">The first sketch of the robot.</p>
        <p>The idea was to use a color sensor to determine when to water the plant or not, which was sort of an afterthought. What became clear quickly was that we had no way to control the water pump. We didn't have enough lego to build the system as we imagined it.</p>
        <p>So we scrapped that design. The final design (shown above), was a compromise we ended up with. One of the members of the group had an Arduino we could use. We tracked down a moisture sensor to connect to the arduino, but we had no way for the Arduino to communicate with the EV3 Device.</p>
        <p>Our solution was to use a light on the Arduino that would activate when the moisture detector couldn't detect moisture, which would prompt the EV3 to activate an arm that would move over the plants to water them.</p>
        <p>While this is not a practical system by any means, it was a fun project to build.</p>
        <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The key takeaway from this project was the importance of scope and communication. Several times during this project it became clear that our initial idea simply wasn't feasible, either due to time constraints or practicality. Being in communication with one another and having set clear goals before hand helped us adjust on the fly. In the end we developed a project that, while not matching our original scope, I think we're all proud of.</p>

        <h3>Group</h3>
        <p>This was a group project done with a couple of classmates. You can find out more about the group on the gitlab page linked below.</p>
