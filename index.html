        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 1.5em">My name is Sasha.</p>
        <p>
            I am a first year student in Computer Engineering (BIDATA) at NTNU.
         On this website you'll find an overview of the projects and assignments I've completed over the last couple of years, the projects I'm working on right now, and perhaps some projects I'm looking forward to working on in the future. For the time being, I intend to make as much of my work available here as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of School and Programming, I enjoy spending my time climbing, making music, and writing. <a href="/goals.html">On this page</a> you can find an overview of personal projects I'll be taking on in my spare time.
