                    Hi! My name is Sasha. I'm a Computer Engineering student and hobbyist-generalist. When I'm not studying I enjoy everything from reading to music to drawing and climbing. This is how I spend most of my time.

        <p style="font-weight: 600;padding-top: 2em;">Why?</p>
        <p>
            I suppose the obvious question is, "Why computer engineering?". The answer is pretty straightforward. I've alwys been interested in the functionality of things. My favourite show growing up was "How things Work" because seeing how everyday objects were produced and put together fascinated me. I would say in this way that I'm more into programming by happenstance. I've spent a lot of time using computers, whether it be for games, work or art projects. Wanting to understand how they work, and how I could make them work, was just sort of the the next step.
